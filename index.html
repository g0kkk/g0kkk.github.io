  <p>I'm a Security Engineer at <a href="https://lucidmotors.com/">Lucid Motors</a> working on vulnerability discovery in ARM and x86 applications. My focus areas include static analysis, binary reverse engineering, dynamic instrumentation, and fuzzing. I have a broader interest in automated exploitability detection, firmware security, and techniques for scaling vulnerability research.</p>
  <p>Previously at Arizona State University, I co-authored research on binary vulnerability discovery and competed with <a href="https://shellphish.net/">Shellphish</a> and <a href="https://bi0s.in/">Team bi0s</a>.</p>
  <p>Outside of work, I enjoy running, exploring trails, and photography.</p>
