  <p>I'm a Security Engineer at <a href="https://lucidmotors.com/">Lucid Motors</a> working on vulnerability discovery in ARM and x86 applications. My focus areas include static analysis, binary reverse engineering, dynamic instrumentation, and fuzzing. I have a broader interest in automated exploitability detection, firmware security, and techniques for scaling vulnerability research.</p>
